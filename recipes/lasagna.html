    <P> Lasagne originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. 
        The oldest transcribed text about lasagna appears in 1282 in the Memoriali Bolognesi ("Bolognesi Memorials"), 
        in which lasagna was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary;[4][5] while the first recorded recipe 
        was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery).[6] 
        It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagne, 
        featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets (lasagne), boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, 
        and then eaten with a small pointed stick.[7] Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina 
        recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. 
        In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended. </P>
